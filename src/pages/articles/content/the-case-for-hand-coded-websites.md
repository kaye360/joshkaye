When it comes to building a website for your small business, you’ve probably heard of platforms like WordPress and Wix. They promise ease and convenience, but sometimes these tools are simply not [the right choice for a small business](/articles/what-a-small-business-owner-needs-to-know-website).

## Lightning-Fast Load Times
Speed matters. A hand-coded website is lean and efficient, meaning no unnecessary code slowing things down. Unlike website builders that load tons of extra scripts in the background, a custom-built site loads only what’s needed—giving your visitors a smooth, snappy experience. And let’s be honest, no one likes waiting for a page to load!

Most website builders rely on databases to store content, which can slow things down and create security risks. Hand-coded websites don’t need databases, meaning fewer moving parts and faster performance. Plus, no database means no complex errors—just clean, simple code that works.

## Hackers Hate Hand-Coded Sites
Hackers love WordPress and Wix because they have predictable security vulnerabilities. WordPress, for example, is open-source. This means anybody can view the core-code that runs any WordPress website. A hand-coded website, on the other hand, has almost no backdoors for cybercriminals to exploit. With fewer points of attack, your site stays secure, giving you and your customers peace of mind.

## Better SEO = More Visibility
Google loves fast, well-structured websites. With a hand-coded site, you have full control over SEO (Search Engine Optimization), making it easier for your business to rank higher in search results. That means more eyeballs on your site and more potential customers walking through your (physical or digital) doors.

## Cost-Effective in the Long Run
While website builders might seem cheap upfront, their ongoing costs (subscriptions, plugins, premium themes) can add up fast. A hand-coded website is a one-time investment with minimal upkeep—saving you money over time. Think of it like buying a car instead of leasing one forever.

## Compared to WordPress and Wix…
Let’s face it—drag-and-drop builders are convenient, [but they come with limitations](/articles/the-problems-with-wordpress-wix-squarespace): slow performance, security risks, and bloated code. A will deliver better results in terms of speed, security, and SEO—all leading to higher engagement and more potential customers.

## Your Bottom Line
If you want a website that’s fast, secure, cost-effective, and SEO-friendly, hand-coding is the way to go. It’s like having a custom-tailored suit instead of something off the rack—it just fits your business better.

Want a site that works harder for you? Consider going the hand-coded route. Your future customers (and your wallet) will thank you!
