Of course, you can—but should you?

DIY site builders like Wix, SquareSpace, and WordPress promise an easy, no-code way to build a website. But while they seem convenient, they come with limitations that can impact your site’s performance, security, and brand identity.

Here are some things to consider with these tools.

## Do You Know How to Structure Content for SEO and Business Goals?
A good website isn’t just about looking nice—it needs proper headlines, structured content, and a strategic layout to guide visitors toward your goals. DIY platforms give you templates, but they don’t teach you best practices for user experience or SEO. 

_Without this knowledge, you might end up with a pretty site that doesn’t convert visitors into customers._

## DIY Sites Tend to Be Slower
Most site builders rely on extra scripts, bloated code, and database calls, which slow down loading times. A slow site frustrates users and hurts your Google rankings. Speed is a crucial factor for both SEO and user experience, and DIY builders often fall short.

## Security Risks: More Prone to Hacking
Since DIY platforms are widely used and follow standardized structures, they become frequent targets for hackers. Plugins, third-party integrations, and shared hosting environments can create vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of attacks.

## Limited Customization for Your Brand
Your website should be a unique extension of your brand. With DIY builders, you’re often stuck with predefined templates and limited customization options. This makes it harder to create a site that truly stands out or scales with your business.

## Hidden Costs: More Expensive Than You Think
While DIY builders seem affordable at first, costs can quickly add up. Monthly subscription fees, premium themes, necessary plugins, and third-party tools can make maintaining your site expensive. Additionally, if you lack the expertise to optimize or customize your site properly, you may need to hire a professional, making it even costlier in the long run.

## What's the best solution for your small business?
Don't get me wrong, there is definitely the right time and place for these sites. If you require constant website updates by multiple members of your team, sitebuilders may be the right solutiom. If you need an online store, WordPress or Shopify can be great options. [I can work with these tools as well.](/get-started?plan=custom)

For small business websites that requre better performance, security, and flexibility, [**consider a hand-coded website**](/articles/the-case-for-hand-coded-websites). A custom-built site is optimized for speed, tailored to your brand, and designed with security in mind. It may require an experienced developer, but the long-term benefits—better SEO, higher conversions, and a unique brand presence—make it worth the investment.

So, should you use a DIY site builder? You can, but if you want a fast, secure, and truly customized website, a hand-coded solution is the smarter choice. [Let me know if I can help you out!](/get-started)
