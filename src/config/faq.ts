        question : `Why do you hand-code websites instead of using WordPress or Wix?`,
        answer : `I hand-code websites to prioritize speed, ensuring your site loads quickly and doesn't lose customers due to slow performance. This approach also improves SEO, enhances security, and simplifies maintenance, giving you full control over design and functionality while minimizing future issues. <br /><br /> Site builders such as WordPress tend to be bloated, slower, and more susceptible to hackers than hand-coded sites. There are almost no potential entrypoints for hackers to gain access to your source code.`,
    },
    { 
        question : `Why are your prices less than other agencies?`,
        answer : `Other agencies can charge between $5,000 and $10,000 for similar websites. My streamlined approach gives you a similar product at an affordable price. I am a solo web designer and web developer; thus I simply do not have the same business costs as other agencies.`,

Every piece is written and placed to boost your search engine rankings and help drive more traffic to your site. <br /><br /> If you would like to provide content, that is okay as well.`,

        question : `Why are hand-coded websites generally faster than WordPress or Wix?`,

    },
    { 
        question : `Why are hand-coded websites generally more secure than WordPress or Wix?`,
        answer : `Hand-coded websites are generally more secure than WordPress or Wix because they don't rely on third-party plugins or themes, which can introduce vulnerabilities. WordPress, being open-source, has code that is publicly accessible, making it a more frequent target for hackers.`,
    },
    { 
        question : `Do I own my website and code?`,
        answer : `Some web design agencies will own your code while you are on one of their plans. I do not operate this way. Once the site is paid for and turned over, you may have the source code upon request.`,
